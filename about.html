						<h2>Git in the Habit</h2>

						<p>This workshop is intended for programmers who are interested in learning how to use the git version control system. We will be covering basic usage, branching, merging and how to use Git for collaboration.</p>

						<p>This year, we're going to spice things up a bit and learn git from the command-line. If you're not too comfortable with command-line, don't be scared! We're here to help and plus, it's not a bad thing being out of your comfort zone sometimes.</p>

						<h2>What is version control and why should I care?</h2>

						<p>Version control is a system that keeps track of changes to a file or a set of files so that you can refer back to specific versions later. This is especially helpful for code collaboration (imagine Google Docs on steroids) but also butt-saver if you ever royally screw up your code and wish to go back in time when it was actually working...</p>
